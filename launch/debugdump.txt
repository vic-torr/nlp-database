0240: Well, good night..    If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,.    
0280: The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste...FRANCISCO: I think
02c0:  I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?: Enter HORATIO and MARCELL
0300: US..HORATIO: Friends to this ground...MARCELLUS: And liegemen to
0340:  the Dane...FRANCISCO: Give you good night...MARCELLUS: O, farew
0380: ell, honest soldier:.    Who hath relieved you?..FRANCISCO: Bern

0480: Marcellus...MARCELLUS: What, has this thing appear'd again to-ni
04c0: ght?..BERNARDO: I have seen nothing...MARCELLUS: Horatio says 't
0500: is but our fantasy,.    And will not let belief take hold of him
0540: .    Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:.    Therefor
0580: e I have entreated him along.    With us to watch the minutes of
05c0:  this night;.    That if again this apparition come,.    He may 
0600: approve our eyes and speak to it...HORATIO: Tush, tush, 'twill n
0640: ot appear...BERNARDO: Sit down awhile;.    And let us once again
0680:  assail your ears,.    That are so fortified against our story. 
06c0:    What we have two nights seen...HORATIO: Well, sit we down,.  
0700:   And let us hear Bernardo speak of this...BERNARDO: Last night 
0740: of all,.    When yond same star that's westward from the pole.  
0780:   Had made his course to illume that part of heaven.    Where no
07c0: w it burns, Marcellus and myself,.    The bell then beating one,
0800: --: Enter Ghost..MARCELLUS: Peace, break thee off; look, where i
0840: t comes again!..BERNARDO: In the same figure, like the king that
0880: 's dead...MARCELLUS: Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio...
08c0: BERNARDO: Looks it not like the king? mark it, Horatio...HORATIO
0900: : Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder...BERNARDO: It w
0940: ould be spoke to...MARCELLUS: Question it, Horatio...HORATIO: Wh
0980: at art thou that usurp'st this time of night,.    Together with 
09c0: that fair and warlike form.    In which the majesty of buried De
0a00: nmark.    Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!..
0a40: MARCELLUS: It is offended...BERNARDO: See, it stalks away!..HORA
0a80: TIO: Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!: Exit Ghost..MARC
0ac0: ELLUS: 'Tis gone, and will not answer...BERNARDO: How now, Horat
0b00: io! you tremble and look pale:.    Is not this something more th
0b40: an fantasy?.    What think you on't?..HORATIO: Before my God, I 
0b80: might not this believe.    Without the sensible and true avouch.
0bc0:     Of mine own eyes...MARCELLUS: Is it not like the king?..HORA
0c00: TIO: As thou art to thyself:.    Such was the very armour he had
0c40:  on.    When he the ambitious Norway combated;.    So frown'd he
0c80:  once, when, in an angry parle,.    He smote the sledded Polacks
0cc0:  on the ice..    'Tis strange...MARCELLUS: Thus twice before, an
0d00: d jump at this dead hour,.    With martial stalk hath he gone by
0d40:  our watch...HORATIO: In what particular thought to work I know 
0d80: not;.    But in the gross and scope of my opinion,.    This bode
0dc0: s some strange eruption to our state...MARCELLUS: Good now, sit 
0e00: down, and tell me, he that knows,.    Why this same strict and m
0e40: ost observant watch.    So nightly toils the subject of the land
0e80: ,.    And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,.    And foreign 
0ec0: mart for implements of war;.    Why such impress of shipwrights,
0f00:  whose sore task.    Does not divide the Sunday from the week;. 
0f40:    What might be toward, that this sweaty haste.    Doth make th
0f80: e night joint-labourer with the day:.    Who is't that can infor
0fc0: m me?..HORATIO: That can I;.    At least, the whisper goes so. O
1000: ur last king,.    Whose image even but now appear'd to us,.    W
1040: as, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,.    Thereto prick'd on
1080:  by a most emulate pride,.    Dared to the combat; in which our 
10c0: valiant Hamlet--.    For so this side of our known world esteem'
1100: d him--.    Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,. 
1140:    Well ratified by law and heraldry,.    Did forfeit, with his 
1180: life, all those his lands.    Which he stood seized of, to the c
11c0: onqueror:.    Against the which, a moiety competent.    Was gage
1200: d by our king; which had return'd.    To the inheritance of Fort
1240: inbras,.    Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,.  
1280:   And carriage of the article design'd,.    His fell to Hamlet. 
12c0: Now, sir, young Fortinbras,.    Of unimproved mettle hot and ful
1300: l,.    Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there.    Shark'd u
1340: p a list of lawless resolutes,.    For food and diet, to some en
1380: terprise.    That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--.    A
13c0: s it doth well appear unto our state--.    But to recover of us,
1400:  by strong hand.    And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
1440: .    So by his father lost: and this, I take it,.    Is the main
1480:  motive of our preparations,.    The source of this our watch an
14c0: d the chief head.    Of this post-haste and romage in the land..
1500: .BERNARDO: I think it be no other but e'en so:.    Well may it s
1540: ort that this portentous figure.    Comes armed through our watc
1580: h; so like the king.    That was and is the question of these wa
15c0: rs...HORATIO: A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye..    In the
1600:  most high and palmy state of Rome,.    A little ere the mightie
1640: st Julius fell,.    The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted 
1680: dead.    Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:.    As star
16c0: s with trains of fire and dews of blood,.    Disasters in the su
1700: n; and the moist star.    Upon whose influence Neptune's empire 
1740: stands.    Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:.    And eve
1780: n the like precurse of fierce events,.    As harbingers precedin
17c0: g still the fates.    And prologue to the omen coming on,.    Ha
1800: ve heaven and earth together demonstrated.    Unto our climature
1840: s and countrymen.--.    But soft, behold! lo, where it comes aga
1880: in!: Re-enter Ghost.    I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay,
18c0:  illusion!.    If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,.    Spea
1900: k to me:.    If there be any good thing to be done,.    That may
1940:  to thee do ease and grace to me,.    Speak to me:: Cock crows. 
1980:    If thou art privy to thy country's fate,.    Which, happily, 
19c0: foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!.    Or if thou hast uphoarded i
1a00: n thy life.    Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,.    For w
1a40: hich, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,.    Speak of it: 
1a80: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus...MARCELLUS: Shall I strike 
1ac0: at it with my partisan?..HORATIO: Do, if it will not stand...BER
1b00: NARDO: 'Tis here!..HORATIO: 'Tis here!..MARCELLUS: 'Tis gone!: E
1b40: xit Ghost.    We do it wrong, being so majestical,.    To offer 
1b80: it the show of violence;.    For it is, as the air, invulnerable
1bc0: ,.    And our vain blows malicious mockery...BERNARDO: It was ab
1c00: out to speak, when the cock crew...HORATIO: And then it started 
1c40: like a guilty thing.    Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,.  
1c80:   The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,.    Doth with his l
1cc0: ofty and shrill-sounding throat.    Awake the god of day; and, a
1d00: t his warning,.    Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,.    
1d40: The extravagant and erring spirit hies.    To his confine: and o
1d80: f the truth herein.    This present object made probation...MARC
1dc0: ELLUS: It faded on the crowing of the cock..    Some say that ev
1e00: er 'gainst that season comes.    Wherein our Saviour's birth is 
1e40: celebrated,.    The bird of dawning singeth all night long:.    
1e80: And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;.    The nights 
1ec0: are wholesome; then no planets strike,.    No fairy takes, nor w
1f00: itch hath power to charm,.    So hallow'd and so gracious is the
1f40:  time...HORATIO: So have I heard and do in part believe it..    
1f80: But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,.    Walks o'er the d
1fc0: ew of yon high eastward hill:.    Break we our watch up; and by 
2000: my advice,.    Let us impart what we have seen to-night.    Unto
2040:  young Hamlet; for, upon my life,.    This spirit, dumb to us, w
2080: ill speak to him..    Do you consent we shall acquaint him with 
20c0: it,.    As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?..MARCELLUS: L
2100: et's do't, I pray; and I this morning know.    Where we shall fi
2140: nd him most conveniently.: Exeunt..SCENE II. A room of state in 
2180: the castle.: Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET, POLONI
21c0: US, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords, and Attendants ..KING 
2200: CLAUDIUS: Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death.    The 
2240: memory be green, and that it us befitted.    To bear our hearts 
2280: in grief and our whole kingdom.    To be contracted in one brow 
22c0: of woe,.    Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature.    Th
2300: at we with wisest sorrow think on him,.    Together with remembr
2340: ance of ourselves..    Therefore our sometime sister, now our qu
2380: een,.    The imperial jointress to this warlike state,.    Have 
23c0: we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--.    With an auspicious and 
2400: a dropping eye,.    With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marr
2440: iage,.    In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--.    Taken 
2480: to wife: nor have we herein barr'd.    Your better wisdoms, whic
24c0: h have freely gone.    With this affair along. For all, our than
2500: ks..    Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,.    Holdin
2540: g a weak supposal of our worth,.    Or thinking by our late dear
2580:  brother's death.    Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,.
25c0:     Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,.    He hath not 
2600: fail'd to pester us with message,.    Importing the surrender of
2640:  those lands.    Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,.    
2680: To our most valiant brother. So much for him..    Now for oursel
26c0: f and for this time of meeting:.    Thus much the business is: w
2700: e have here writ.    To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--.   
2740:  Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears.    Of this his nephe
2780: w's purpose,--to suppress.    His further gait herein; in that t
27c0: he levies,.    The lists and full proportions, are all made.    
2800: Out of his subject: and we here dispatch.    You, good Cornelius
2840: , and you, Voltimand,.    For bearers of this greeting to old No
2880: rway;.    Giving to you no further personal power.    To busines
28c0: s with the king, more than the scope.    Of these delated articl
2900: es allow..    Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty...C
2940: ORNELIUS VOLTIMAND: In that and all things will we show our duty
2980: ...KING CLAUDIUS: We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.: Exeun
29c0: t VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS.    And now, Laertes, what's the news 
2a00: with you?.    You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?.    
2a40: You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,.    And loose your voice
2a80: : what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,.    That shall not be my offer
2ac0: , not thy asking?.    The head is not more native to the heart,.
2b00:     The hand more instrumental to the mouth,.    Than is the thr
2b40: one of Denmark to thy father..    What wouldst thou have, Laerte
2b80: s?..LAERTES: My dread lord,.    Your leave and favour to return 
2bc0: to France;.    From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,. 
2c00:    To show my duty in your coronation,.    Yet now, I must confe
2c40: ss, that duty done,.    My thoughts and wishes bend again toward
2c80:  France.    And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon...KIN
2cc0: G CLAUDIUS: Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?..L
2d00: ORD POLONIUS: He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave.    
2d40: By laboursome petition, and at last.    Upon his will I seal'd m
2d80: y hard consent:.    I do beseech you, give him leave to go...KIN
2dc0: G CLAUDIUS: Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,.    And 
2e00: thy best graces spend it at thy will!.    But now, my cousin Ham
2e40: let, and my son,--..HAMLET: [Aside] A little more than kin, and 
2e80: less than kind...KING CLAUDIUS: How is it that the clouds still 
2ec0: hang on you?..HAMLET: Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.
2f00: ..QUEEN GERTRUDE: Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,.    
2f40: And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark..    Do not for 
2f80: ever with thy vailed lids.    Seek for thy noble father in the d
2fc0: ust:.    Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,.    
3000: Passing through nature to eternity...HAMLET: Ay, madam, it is co
3040: mmon...QUEEN GERTRUDE: If it be,.    Why seems it so particular 
3080: with thee?..HAMLET: Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'
30c0: .    'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,.    Nor customar
3100: y suits of solemn black,.    Nor windy suspiration of forced bre
3140: ath,.    No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,.    Nor the deje
3180: cted 'havior of the visage,.    Together with all forms, moods, 
31c0: shapes of grief,.    That can denote me truly: these indeed seem
3200: ,.    For they are actions that a man might play:.    But I have
3240:  that within which passeth show;.    These but the trappings and
3280:  the suits of woe...KING CLAUDIUS: 'Tis sweet and commendable in
32c0:  your nature, Hamlet,.    To give these mourning duties to your 
3300: father:.    But, you must know, your father lost a father;.    T
3340: hat father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound.    In filial 
3380: obligation for some term.    To do obsequious sorrow: but to per
33c0: sever.    In obstinate condolement is a course.    Of impious st
3400: ubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;.    It shows a will most incorre
3440: ct to heaven,.    A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,.    An 
3480: understanding simple and unschool'd:.    For what we know must b
34c0: e and is as common.    As any the most vulgar thing to sense,.  
3500:   Why should we in our peevish opposition.    Take it to heart? 
3540: Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,.    A fault against the dead, a fau
3580: lt to nature,.    To reason most absurd: whose common theme.    
35c0: Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,.    From the firs
3600: t corse till he that died to-day,.    'This must be so.' We pray
3640:  you, throw to earth.    This unprevailing woe, and think of us.
3680:     As of a father: for let the world take note,.    You are the
36c0:  most immediate to our throne;.    And with no less nobility of 
3700: love.    Than that which dearest father bears his son,.    Do I 
3740: impart toward you. For your intent.    In going back to school i
3780: n Wittenberg,.    It is most retrograde to our desire:.    And w
37c0: e beseech you, bend you to remain.    Here, in the cheer and com
3800: fort of our eye,.    Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
3840: ..QUEEN GERTRUDE: Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:. 
3880:    I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg...HAMLET: I s
38c0: hall in all my best obey you, madam...KING CLAUDIUS: Why, 'tis a
3900:  loving and a fair reply:.    Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, c
3940: ome;.    This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet.    Sits smil
3980: ing to my heart: in grace whereof,.    No jocund health that Den
39c0: mark drinks to-day,.    But the great cannon to the clouds shall
3a00:  tell,.    And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,.   
3a40:  Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.: Exeunt all but HAMLET.
3a80: .HAMLET: O, that this too too solid flesh would melt.    Thaw an
3ac0: d resolve itself into a dew!.    Or that the Everlasting had not
3b00:  fix'd.    His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!.    How
3b40:  weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,.    Seem to me all the use
3b80: s of this world!.    Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,.
3bc0:     That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature.    Poss
3c00: ess it merely. That it should come to this!.    But two months d
3c40: ead: nay, not so much, not two:.    So excellent a king; that wa
3c80: s, to this,.    Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother.    
3cc0: That he might not beteem the winds of heaven.    Visit her face 
3d00: too roughly. Heaven and earth!.    Must I remember? why, she wou
3d40: ld hang on him,.    As if increase of appetite had grown.    By 
3d80: what it fed on: and yet, within a month--.    Let me not think o
3dc0: n't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--.    A little month, or ere th
3e00: ose shoes were old.    With which she follow'd my poor father's 
3e40: body,.    Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--.    O, God
3e80: ! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,.    Would have mourn'
3ec0: d longer--married with my uncle,.    My father's brother, but no
3f00:  more like my father.    Than I to Hercules: within a month:.   
3f40:  Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears.    Had left the flu
3f80: shing in her galled eyes,.    She married. O, most wicked speed,
3fc0:  to post.    With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!.    It is
4000:  not nor it cannot come to good:.    But break, my heart; for I 
4040: must hold my tongue.: Enter HORATIO, MARCELLUS, and BERNARDO..HO

9ac0:   The effect of what I wrote?..HORATIO: Ay, good my lord...HAMLE
9b00: T: An earnest conjuration from the king,.    As England was his 
9b40: faithful tributary,.    As love between them like the palm might
9b80:  flourish,.    As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear.  
9bc0:   And stand a comma 'tween their amities,.    And many such-like
9c00:  'As'es of great charge,.    That, on the view and knowing of th
9c40: ese contents,.    Without debatement further, more or less,.    
9c80: He should the bearers put to sudden death,.    Not shriving-time
9cc0:  allow'd...HORATIO: How was this seal'd?..HAMLET: Why, even in t
9d00: hat was heaven ordinant..    I had my father's signet in my purs
9d40: e,.    Which was the model of that Danish seal;.    Folded the w
9d80: rit up in form of the other,.    Subscribed it, gave't the impre
9dc0: ssion, placed it safely,.    The changeling never known. Now, th
9e00: e next day.    Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent. 
9e40:    Thou know'st already...HORATIO: So Guildenstern and Rosencran
9e80: tz go to't...HAMLET: Why, man, they did make love to this employ
9ec0: ment;.    They are not near my conscience; their defeat.    Does
9f00:  by their own insinuation grow:.    'Tis dangerous when the base
9f40: r nature comes.    Between the pass and fell incensed points.   
9f80:  Of mighty opposites...HORATIO: Why, what a king is this!..HAMLE
9fc0: T: Does it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon--.    He that h
a000: ath kill'd my king and whored my mother,.    Popp'd in between t
a040: he election and my hopes,.    Thrown out his angle for my proper
a080:  life,.    And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience,.
a0c0:     To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd,.    To
a100:  let this canker of our nature come.    In further evil?..HORATI
a140: O: It must be shortly known to him from England.    What is the 
a180: issue of the business there...HAMLET: It will be short: the inte
a1c0: rim is mine;.    And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.'. 
a200:    But I am very sorry, good Horatio,.    That to Laertes I forg
a240: ot myself;.    For, by the image of my cause, I see.    The port
a280: raiture of his: I'll court his favours..    But, sure, the brave
a2c0: ry of his grief did put me.    Into a towering passion...HORATIO
a300: : Peace! who comes here?: Enter OSRIC..OSRIC: Your lordship is r
a340: ight welcome back to Denmark...HAMLET: I humbly thank you, sir. 
a380: Dost know this water-fly?..HORATIO: No, my good lord...HAMLET: T
a3c0: hy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to.    know him. 
a400: He hath much land, and fertile: let a.    beast be lord of beast
a440: s, and his crib shall stand at.    the king's mess: 'tis a choug
a480: h; but, as I say,.    spacious in the possession of dirt...OSRIC
a4c0: : Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I.    should imp
a500: art a thing to you from his majesty...HAMLET: I will receive it,
a540:  sir, with all diligence of.    spirit. Put your bonnet to his r
a580: ight use; 'tis for the head...OSRIC: I thank your lordship, it i
a5c0: s very hot...HAMLET: No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is
a600: .    northerly...OSRIC: It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
a640: ..HAMLET: But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my.    
a680: complexion...OSRIC: Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,--as
a6c0: .    'twere,--I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his.    majesty b
a700: ade me signify to you that he has laid a.    great wager on your
a740:  head: sir, this is the matter,--..HAMLET: I beseech you, rememb
a780: er--: HAMLET moves him to put on his hat..OSRIC: Nay, good my lo
a7c0: rd; for mine ease, in good faith..    Sir, here is newly come to
a800:  court Laertes; believe.    me, an absolute gentleman, full of m
a840: ost excellent.    differences, of very soft society and great sh
a880: owing:.    indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or.
a8c0:     calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the.    contin
a900: ent of what part a gentleman would see...HAMLET: Sir, his define
a940: ment suffers no perdition in you;.    though, I know, to divide 
a980: him inventorially would.    dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and 
a9c0: yet but yaw.    neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in t
aa00: he.    verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of.    great
aa40:  article; and his infusion of such dearth and.    rareness, as, 
aa80: to make true diction of him, his.    semblable is his mirror; an
aac0: d who else would trace.    him, his umbrage, nothing more...OSRI
ab00: C: Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him...HAMLET: The con
ab40: cernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman.    in our more rawe
ab80: r breath?..OSRIC: Sir?..HORATIO: Is't not possible to understand
abc0:  in another tongue?.    You will do't, sir, really...HAMLET: Wha
ac00: t imports the nomination of this gentleman?..OSRIC: Of Laertes?.
ac40: .HORATIO: His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spe
ac80: nt...HAMLET: Of him, sir...OSRIC: I know you are not ignorant--.
acc0: .HAMLET: I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did,.    it
ad00:  would not much approve me. Well, sir?..OSRIC: You are not ignor
ad40: ant of what excellence Laertes is--..HAMLET: I dare not confess 
ad80: that, lest I should compare with.    him in excellence; but, to 
adc0: know a man well, were to.    know himself...OSRIC: I mean, sir, 
ae00: for his weapon; but in the imputation.    laid on him by them, i
ae40: n his meed he's unfellowed...HAMLET: What's his weapon?..OSRIC: 
ae80: Rapier and dagger...HAMLET: That's two of his weapons: but, well
aec0: ...OSRIC: The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary.    h
af00: orses: against the which he has imponed, as I take.    it, six F
af40: rench rapiers and poniards, with their.    assigns, as girdle, h
af80: angers, and so: three of the.    carriages, in faith, are very d
afc0: ear to fancy, very.    responsive to the hilts, most delicate ca
b000: rriages,.    and of very liberal conceit...HAMLET: What call you
b040:  the carriages?..HORATIO: I knew you must be edified by the marg
b080: ent ere you had done...OSRIC: The carriages, sir, are the hanger
b0c0: s...HAMLET: The phrase would be more german to the matter, if we
b100: .    could carry cannon by our sides: I would it might.    be ha
b140: ngers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses.    against six Fre
b180: nch swords, their assigns, and three.    liberal-conceited carri
b1c0: ages; that's the French bet.    against the Danish. Why is this 
b200: 'imponed,' as you call it?..OSRIC: The king, sir, hath laid, tha
b240: t in a dozen passes.    between yourself and him, he shall not e
b280: xceed you.    three hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and i
b2c0: t.    would come to immediate trial, if your lordship.    would 
b300: vouchsafe the answer...HAMLET: How if I answer 'no'?..OSRIC: I m
b340: ean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial...HAMLET: S
b380: ir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his.    majesty, 
b3c0: 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let.    the foils be bro
b400: ught, the gentleman willing, and the.    king hold his purpose, 
b440: I will win for him an I can;.    if not, I will gain nothing but
b480:  my shame and the odd hits...OSRIC: Shall I re-deliver you e'en 
b4c0: so?..HAMLET: To this effect, sir; after what flourish your natur
b500: e will...OSRIC: I commend my duty to your lordship...HAMLET: You
b540: rs, yours.: Exit OSRIC.    He does well to commend it himself; t
b580: here are no.    tongues else for's turn...HORATIO: This lapwing 
b5c0: runs away with the shell on his head...HAMLET: He did comply wit
b600: h his dug, before he sucked it..    Thus has he--and many more o
b640: f the same bevy that I.    know the dressy age dotes on--only go
b680: t the tune of.    the time and outward habit of encounter; a kin
b6c0: d of.    yesty collection, which carries them through and.    th
b700: rough the most fond and winnowed opinions; and do.    but blow t
b740: hem to their trial, the bubbles are out.: Enter a Lord..Lord: My
b780:  lord, his majesty commended him to you by young.    Osric, who 
b7c0: brings back to him that you attend him in.    the hall: he sends
b800:  to know if your pleasure hold to.    play with Laertes, or that
b840:  you will take longer time...HAMLET: I am constant to my purpose
b880: ; they follow the king's.    pleasure: if his fitness speaks, mi
b8c0: ne is ready; now.    or whensoever, provided I be so able as now
b900: ...Lord: The king and queen and all are coming down...HAMLET: In
b940:  happy time...Lord: The queen desires you to use some gentle.   
b980:  entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play...HAMLET: She 
b9c0: well instructs me.: Exit Lord..HORATIO: You will lose this wager
ba00: , my lord...HAMLET: I do not think so: since he went into France
ba40: , I.    have been in continual practise: I shall win at the.    
ba80: odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here.    about my
bac0:  heart: but it is no matter...HORATIO: Nay, good my lord,--..HAM
bb00: LET: It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of.    gain-giving
bb40: , as would perhaps trouble a woman...HORATIO: If your mind disli
bb80: ke any thing, obey it: I will.    forestall their repair hither,
bbc0:  and say you are not.    fit...HAMLET: Not a whit, we defy augur
bc00: y: there's a special.    providence in the fall of a sparrow. If
bc40:  it be now,.    'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will 
bc80: be.    now; if it be not now, yet it will come: the.    readines

bec0:  That might your nature, honour and exception.    Roughly awake,

bfc0: t not, Hamlet denies it..    Who does it, then? His madness: if'
